I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector.

Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ₹99/- with the offers and so I wasn’t sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone’s battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ₹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn’t tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn’t get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money</td><td>https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31VzNhhqifL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg</td><td>https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-Konnect-POR-1080-Charging-Function/dp/B08CF3B7N1/ref=sr_1_5?qid=1672909124&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-5</td></tr>\n",

I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  & https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP\\_402378-T2/images/I/31zOsqQOAOL.\\_SY445\\_SX342\\_QL70\\_FMwebp\\_.jpg & https://www.amazon.in/Ambrane-Unbreakable-Charging-Braided-Cable/dp/B098NS6PVG/ref=sr\\_1\\_2?qid=1672909124\\&s=electronics\\&sr=1-2   \\\\\n",

Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100\\% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ₹99/- with the offers and so I wasn’t sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone’s battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ₹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn’t tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn’t get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money & https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP\\_402378-T2/images/I/31VzNhhqifL.\\_SX300\\_SY300\\_QL70\\_FMwebp\\_.jpg & https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-Konnect-POR-1080-Charging-Function/dp/B08CF3B7N1/ref=sr\\_1\\_5?qid=1672909124\\&s=electronics\\&sr=1-5\\\\\n",

I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31zOsqQOAOL._SY445_SX342_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg | https://www.amazon.in/Ambrane-Unbreakable-Charging-Braided-Cable/dp/B098NS6PVG/ref=sr_1_2?qid=1672909124&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-2    |\n",

Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ₹99/- with the offers and so I wasn’t sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone’s battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ₹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn’t tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn’t get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money | https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31VzNhhqifL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg | https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-Konnect-POR-1080-Charging-Function/dp/B08CF3B7N1/ref=sr_1_5?qid=1672909124&amp;s=electronics&amp;sr=1-5 |\n",

       "2 I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car. The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it's still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "5 Bought this instead of original apple, does the work for 150rs, not as fast as apple charger but its a good option if you want cheap and good product, bought it for iPad pro 10.5 and it's working flawlessly, build quality is ok, its not like i am gonna hang my clothes on it and i want a very strong cable, even a braided cable stop working after a year, i have used both Anker and Apple store strong braided cable they all stop working after a year so please don't buy high end cables just for that instead choose a this one and even if it's stops working withing a year you only loose 150rs compares to 2000rs.UPDATE------------------------------------pin has stopped charging from one side, now i have to slip the pin to charge from other side, but i will update and let know for how long does it work,,It’s good. Not sure about durability as the pin area feels a bit fragile,Does not support apple carplaySo was little disappointed about thatOther than that cable is made up of very good quality,Best to buy,100% NOT FATHFUL,Writing this review post 10 months and 3 orders of the same product.Honestly Portronics Konnect L lightning cable works like magic with the original Apple charging brick.Seeing the price of the cable I initially hesitated buying as it was as low as ₹99/- with the offers and so I wasn’t sure if it would work well with my iPhone 12 or whether it would impact my iPhone’s battery health because all the other lightning cable brands were costing over ₹350/- like Wayona, Amazon Basics, etc.Earlier I was using Wayona Brand lightning cable with eventually frayed and stopped working.Charging Speed:Charges my iPhone fast enough almost similar compared to the original cable level when used with 12W Original Apple power adapter.Quality and Durability:Great quality braided cable and doesn’t tangle easily and can withstand day-to-day usage.L-Shaped pin:This is very innovative by Portronics and it makes sure the cable doesn’t get damaged even if used while charging.CarPlay and Data Sync:Works smoothly with CarPlay and syncs data effortlessly.PS: I have used this cable only with the Original Apple Charging Brick and extremely satisfied with its performance.,Better than I expect the product I like that Quality and I plan to buy same type cable come with usb C to Lighting cable for emergency purpose that much I love this cable. Buy for this cable only emergency uses only since Good one,Good product and value for money\n",

It might be compatible with your chargers but I tested 2 different car chargers and both didn't go full speed.\n",

      "3 Does the job well,doesn't work on sand. though the suction is very good, the sand stays back no matter which lead you use.,Ok ok,Easy to use product (I used it for the first time without knowing the know-how of its use). Cleans almost 90% of your mess inside the car. Highly recommended.,Pros: look and feel, easy to hold and handle, Cord length, useful led light during night, normal suction power but good enough for general useCons: noise is bit loud, suction power could be better,Good,Hmm,Strudy design, quality accessories,reputated brand.I have seen some car vaccum cleaners especially the low cost one's where dust comes out of machine due to poor locking mechanism, so ofcourse you don't want the dust to be falling back when the sole purpose is to remove it!!!You get what you pay for, I have home vaccum clear from same company with has a good suction and does the job well, I wanted a battery pluggable clearner where I can use it anywhere.Believe me no vaccum cleaner is good enough for heavily soiled cars, so if you are expecting a commercial level cleaning the don't buy any.Car vaccum cleaner is a portable device which gives decent satisfaction but not a perfect, I have seen some people who do not take out mats and just shove the cleaner in it and say it's not good.Mats need to be take out which actually collects big dust and derbies, this poor small machine can't handle a 100% cleaning on that.If the car is heavily soiled the you must get it cleaned at a professional clearner then start using the small one.I found this to be doing the job when compared to my house vaccum clearner.One thing I observed was the wires was getting hot and has a soft component which makes it even thinner when it's hit but I think I can handle the job, accessories quality is good and fir and finishe is good.I did not seen any dust seeping through the compartment and it was well contained in the dust chamber.Suction is decent and you can give almost a clean and tidy look to your car with this machine, again a professional grade cleaners can doa good job which cost nothing less tha 15K.I would say worth a buy it used delligently by not expecting too much.I only hope if the company can provide a bag to carry it for the price or find one in your own which can fit your needs.,Perfect\n",

It might be compatible with your chargers but I tested 2 different car chargers and both didn't go full speed.\n",

      "3 Does the job well,doesn't work on sand. though the suction is very good, the sand stays back no matter which lead you use.,Ok ok,Easy to use product (I used it for the first time without knowing the know-how of its use). Cleans almost 90% of your mess inside the car. Highly recommended.,Pros: look and feel, easy to hold and handle, Cord length, useful led light during night, normal suction power but good enough for general useCons: noise is bit loud, suction power could be better,Good,Hmm,Strudy design, quality accessories,reputated brand.I have seen some car vaccum cleaners especially the low cost one's where dust comes out of machine due to poor locking mechanism, so ofcourse you don't want the dust to be falling back when the sole purpose is to remove it!!!You get what you pay for, I have home vaccum clear from same company with has a good suction and does the job well, I wanted a battery pluggable clearner where I can use it anywhere.Believe me no vaccum cleaner is good enough for heavily soiled cars, so if you are expecting a commercial level cleaning the don't buy any.Car vaccum cleaner is a portable device which gives decent satisfaction but not a perfect, I have seen some people who do not take out mats and just shove the cleaner in it and say it's not good.Mats need to be take out which actually collects big dust and derbies, this poor small machine can't handle a 100% cleaning on that.If the car is heavily soiled the you must get it cleaned at a professional clearner then start using the small one.I found this to be doing the job when compared to my house vaccum clearner.One thing I observed was the wires was getting hot and has a soft component which makes it even thinner when it's hit but I think I can handle the job, accessories quality is good and fir and finishe is good.I did not seen any dust seeping through the compartment and it was well contained in the dust chamber.Suction is decent and you can give almost a clean and tidy look to your car with this machine, again a professional grade cleaners can doa good job which cost nothing less tha 15K.I would say worth a buy it used delligently by not expecting too much.I only hope if the company can provide a bag to carry it for the price or find one in your own which can fit your needs.,Perfect\n",

It might be compatible with your chargers but I tested 2 different car chargers and both didn't go full speed.\n",

      "3 Does the job well,doesn't work on sand. though the suction is very good, the sand stays back no matter which lead you use.,Ok ok,Easy to use product (I used it for the first time without knowing the know-how of its use). Cleans almost 90% of your mess inside the car. Highly recommended.,Pros: look and feel, easy to hold and handle, Cord length, useful led light during night, normal suction power but good enough for general useCons: noise is bit loud, suction power could be better,Good,Hmm,Strudy design, quality accessories,reputated brand.I have seen some car vaccum cleaners especially the low cost one's where dust comes out of machine due to poor locking mechanism, so ofcourse you don't want the dust to be falling back when the sole purpose is to remove it!!!You get what you pay for, I have home vaccum clear from same company with has a good suction and does the job well, I wanted a battery pluggable clearner where I can use it anywhere.Believe me no vaccum cleaner is good enough for heavily soiled cars, so if you are expecting a commercial level cleaning the don't buy any.Car vaccum cleaner is a portable device which gives decent satisfaction but not a perfect, I have seen some people who do not take out mats and just shove the cleaner in it and say it's not good.Mats need to be take out which actually collects big dust and derbies, this poor small machine can't handle a 100% cleaning on that.If the car is heavily soiled the you must get it cleaned at a professional clearner then start using the small one.I found this to be doing the job when compared to my house vaccum clearner.One thing I observed was the wires was getting hot and has a soft component which makes it even thinner when it's hit but I think I can handle the job, accessories quality is good and fir and finishe is good.I did not seen any dust seeping through the compartment and it was well contained in the dust chamber.Suction is decent and you can give almost a clean and tidy look to your car with this machine, again a professional grade cleaners can doa good job which cost nothing less tha 15K.I would say worth a buy it used delligently by not expecting too much.I only hope if the company can provide a bag to carry it for the price or find one in your own which can fit your needs.,Perfect\n",
