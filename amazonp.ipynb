      "I am not big on camera usage, personally. I was even mentally prepared for a bad camera, based on some reviews here. But I was pleasantly surprised that camera clicks good photos. They are not awesome, but they are decent photos that can even be shared.Now coming to my biggest grouse; heating issue. The phone started heating up while charging, but it was just a little and so I could have ignored it. But then it started heating up more and got me very concerned. I even ordered a replacement thinking I got a defective piece. But then, after further tests, I found that it is heating more when I download huge amounts of data, for example, when I restore data of my old phone, from back up. This is ok with me as, I don't perform huge data loads regularly, definitely not on phone. Then I tested by running tasks I usually perform such as checking office mails, attending office meeting on phone, watching a video from Amazon Prime, and so on. The phone did not heat up even a little. Personally, this is good for me.At this price range, this is a good phone. But if you are camera heavy user and expect to perform heavy downloads frequently, this phone may not for you. I am personally satisfied with this phone as it works for my type of usage. I will not go into plus points of this phone as they are covered by other reviews already. I am only attempting to clarify about how this phone can suit you (or not) in terms of camera and heating. I had many questions about these aspects before buying. Perhaps this review will help you make an informed decision to buy (or avoid). Cheers.,Display - BeautyCamera - decentPerformance - AmazingBattery - ok (in 5000mah u expect more tbh)Overall good phone...Also after 1day of use, i found some network connectivity issue in my jiosim, which I'm using right now in this phone, but I'll keep update this review after 1month of usage!,It's a decent mobile under this price but few things worried me , weight of the phone, too many procedure to change some settings, no screen casting. Apart from that it has good touch, a decent camera for day light , battery life is good.,I bought this smartphone for my mom. Samusung interface is very handful for easy use. Battery is superb, last whole day. Camera is mediocre but provide original colour pictures. All in all satisfied with this smartphone that i got in sale for 9499.,Unable to do video call within same service provider as in VOLTE within same service provider video call feature is available.,Product is fine.  Nothing Fancy but for the budget it is a good phone.,BATTERY : more than enough for normal use  Not sure in gamingCAMERA : good in this segment , can record  videos in FHD 30fpsDISPLAY : since it's a LCD display the quality is  a bit less , but goodV RAM : you can add upto 2gb of virtual ram  but have to sacrifice your storage  Space to use it  OVERALL A GOOD BUDGET PHONE,Finger print is working speedy battery backup is good camera quality is also good    8\n",
      "Worked on iPhone 7 and didn’t work on iPhone XR,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71qFFAlV9ZL._SY88.jpg,Look-wise, I didn’t like it. Still, I use it for my work.,Product is quite good and is fast charging.Loved it.,I like it . Looks last long.,The sturdiness will depend on the manner of its use. But its speed of charging is great. Very good product for the average income group.,It's great for charging devices with various types of ports. But works best when charging one device at a time.,Good item.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      7\n",
      "I ordered this cable to connect my phone to Android Auto of car. The cable is really strong and the connection ports are really well made. I already has a Micro USB cable from Ambrane and it's still in good shape. I connected my phone to the car using the cable and it got connected well and no issues. I also connected it to the charging port and yes it has Fast Charging support.,It quality is good at this price and the main thing is that i didn't ever thought that this cable will be so long it's good one and charging power is too good and also supports fast charging,Value for money, with extra length👍,Good, working fine,Product quality is good,Good,very good,Bought for my daughter's old phone.Brand new cable it was not charging, I already repacked and requested for replacement.I checked again, and there was some green colour paste/fungus inside the micro USB connector. I cleaned with an alcoholic and starts working again.Checked the ampere of charging speed got around 1400ma-1500ma - not bad, came with braided 1.5m long cable, pretty impressive for the price.Can't blame the manufacturer.But quality issues by the distributor, they might have stored in very humid place.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             7\n",

      "I generally don't write reviews on Amazon. But this product is worth every penny.Amazing Product1. It is sturdy2. Good heavy-quality metal is used yet still lightweight and portable.3. Can be easily carried in 1 hand4. On Full Open, total Height reaches 5ft 9in (so can even cover if there's a stage)After buying this, I even surveyed the local market, I can now confidently say I have invested in the right product.There are products available for 1,000 Rs, but paying another just 500Rs for such a quality product is a better decision (Keeping in mind long-term use).,Its been 1 yerar 3month i am using the stand fr my video shoots ... Either its indoor or outdoor ..the stand is so strong and so many option to manage your stability and angle.. Even its so handy that often i use it just holding it like a gimble (though it do not stabilize the video) but i am very use to of it bcs of its  compact look...Go fr it... You will not regret 🤞🏻,Likes:Robust, durable, very well assembled.Dislikes:Due to strong built up, and bigger in size it is difficult to record video of the downside part as tripod legs come in the picture along.As mentioned in the product details, phone holder not included. I purchased a new one alongwith this product. However, there was one phone holder given in the Tripod Box. Due to this false detail, I had to purchase one more phone holder which is under non-returnable products category and is to be kept now.,Same As shown In PicturesGood And Well StableReally Wanted One for My video shootsMust Have For Camera And SmartphonesThey Say It Doesn't Have phone Holder, But They have Sent One Included, So Don't Order Already One.Thank You Soo Much For That Merchant.,Mastttt,I really like this amazing product. Worthy money buying it. Don't worry about negative reviews.you are worth buying it.

      "It's a china product to be clear. Look and feel is good. Base of the device is little wider, so if you have 3-pin socket points consecutively then ysing the next socket could be difficult.The wi-fi signal strength is good as extender but it reduces internet speed. For example my internet speed is 30 mbps which I get if directly connected to my primary router / network. But if connected through extender it downgrades to 18-19 mbps. Overall okay to use. I would have been happy to see a made in India device as the price is also not very low, but unfortunately India is not manufacturing any.. it seems.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/716UbI+jJjL._SY88.jpg,Single band is an ancient technology.This device will supply only 2.4 ghzThat means 5ghz will not be available in your room where you choose to use this.,It was difficult to use and install at first, after that it’s been working perfectly with great signal strength!,It is a good product valued for money but I think it should be sometimes give low speed,I wish I could have ordered dual band ...But so far it's giving satisfactory service,Working fine,Product is ok but it’s only for 2.4ghz mistakenly got it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

      "It does it job perfectly..only issue is temp control is not perfect . U need to keep checking the browness of sandwich untill it gets upto ur choise,Product is good, but the control knob is to be be modified cause after the cooking process completes the control knob should be return back to initial starting place. If not that process timer should be given basically. So think well what happens whether didn't had atleast one option.Not a indicator option.,It is a nice product, easy to use. The grilling function is also wonderful. But the exterior metallic finish picks up finger marks and other spots which tend to become permanent. Cleaning them is almost impossible.,Very good product,This is a pretty powerful sandwich maker, for home use. The product looks good, has a sturdy build, and heats up quick. The sandwiches are made pretty quickly, without burning.,बोरोसिल ब्रांड का यह \"सेंडविच मेकर\" देखने में तो अच्छा लगता है मगर इसकी बिल्ड क्वालिटी अच्छी नहीं है।  यह लगभग Rs 3000 के आसपास आता है।  इस प्रकार की बिल्ड क्वालिटी ₹2000 के करीब मिल जाती है तो कोई क्यों ₹1000 अधिक भुगतान करें।  पहले मैंने इसे review देखने के बाद ऑर्डर किया था लेकिन जब घर पर डिलीवरी होने के पश्चात  unboxing करके देखा तो इसकी बिल्ड क्वालिटी कुछ खास नहीं लगी इसलिए अपने पैसे बचाने के लिए मैंने इसे वापस भेज दिया। मैंने इसकी पैकेजिंग, मैनुअल और सैंडविच मेकर की फोटोग्राफ आप सभी से शेयर की है।  आप स्वयं देख के अनुमान लगा सकते हैं।,Recommend work as expected,Its easy tp use                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
